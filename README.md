# rentAll

RentAll is an application designed for local communities, it helps neighbors to share and borrow things like household items or tools.
After signing up you can add items and share them (left panel).
You can search and scroll items owned and shared by neighbours (right panel).
If you want to lend an item, click on “Rent [item] for [x] days” and await for an owner decision.
The owner will get an e-mail and will accept or deny your request.
Each user collects points (visible on top right corner).
